/**
 * Carrying Stripe's word about a desktop subscription onto the licence
 * (addendum 32).
 *
 * **This is the whole of what a renewal does.** A subscription renews every
 * month or every year, and if each renewal made an order and a licence a
 * writer would collect twelve serials a year — so a renewal finds the licence
 * it already has by `stripe_subscription_id` and moves two fields: the status,
 * and the date it is paid up to.
 *
 * Both are Stripe's answer rather than arithmetic done here. The period end is
 * read off the subscription every time it speaks, so a plan changed from
 * monthly to yearly in the customer portal needs no case of its own: Stripe
 * sends an update and the new date is simply what it says.
