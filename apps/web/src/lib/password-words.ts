 * who knows theirs changes it, and the reset page, where somebody who has
 * forgotten it arrives from a link — and they must agree about what a refusal
 * means. So the mapping lives here and each screen asks it, rather than each
 * translating Supabase's wording for itself and drifting the first time one of
 * them is edited.
 *
 * What does **not** live here is the one sentence that is about the screen: the
 * account page can be told the current password is wrong, and the reset page
 * cannot, because it never sends one. Each supplies its own for that case.
