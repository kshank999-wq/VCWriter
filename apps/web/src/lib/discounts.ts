 * nothing** — no table, no cache, no copy of a percentage. `pricing.ts`'s rule
 * on the other half of the transaction.
 *
 * **A coupon is the discount and a promotion code is the word you say**, which
 * is Stripe's own split and worth keeping rather than flattening: one coupon
 * — *20% off* — can carry several codes, which is exactly what advertising in
 * more than one place needs, since each code counts its own redemptions and
 * tells you which advertisement worked. Making one from the admin screen makes
 * both in a single act, because a writer naming a code has not asked to learn
