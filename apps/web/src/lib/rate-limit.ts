/**
 * Per-address rate limiting for the routes anyone can call.
 *
 * What it is for: noise and cost. A burst of telemetry from one address, a
 * script creating checkout sessions, an activation loop. What it is not for:
 * access control — entitlement is checked in every route regardless, and
 * nothing here grants or denies anything but a turn.
 *
 * That is why it fails open. If the database call errors, the request goes
 * through and a warning is logged. A limiter that could take purchases down
 * when it broke would be a worse risk than the one it guards against.
 *
 * Addresses are stored as a keyed hash, never raw, and rows live for two
 * windows at most. That is pseudonymisation, not anonymisation: with the salt
 * a row can be matched to an address again. It is enough for a table whose
 * contents are gone within the hour.
