 *
 * - **Academic** — a giveaway to a school, a class, a teacher or a student. It
 *   covers a set number of computers (two unless said otherwise, the same as
 *   one bought) and may end on a date, which is what a school year is.
 * - **Master** — the owner's own. It covers any number of computers and never
 *   ends, so every machine the owner writes on can be activated without
 *   freeing another.
 *
 * Either is an ordinary licence row behind a $0 order, which is how licences
 * issued by hand have always been kept: activation, downloads, the desk's
 * read-only rule and the account page all read it as they read any other.
